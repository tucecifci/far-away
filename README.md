## My process

### 💡 Built with

- React: For building the user interface.
- CSS: For styling the application with a clean and minimal design.
- JavaScript: To handle logic and interactivity.

### 🧠 What I learned

While working on the Random Quotes Generator project, I learned:

- How to fetch data from an external API using JavaScript.
- How to dynamically update the content of a webpage without refreshing the entire page.
- How to integrate social media sharing functionality into a web application.
- How to structure and style a simple web application using HTML and CSS.
- How to manage project dependencies and version control using Git and GitHub.

```javascript
  var authors = Object.keys(quotes);
  var author = authors[Math.floor(Math.random() * authors.length)];

  var quote = quotes[author];

  document.getElementById("quote").textContent = quote;
  document.getElementById("author").textContent = author;
```

### 👩🏼‍💻 Features

1. Add Items

- Users can add items to their packing list by specifying the quantity and the item name.

- The input includes a dropdown to set the quantity and a text field to enter the item.

2. Mark Items as Packed

- Each item in the list has a checkbox.

- Ticking the checkbox strikes through the item, indicating that it has been packed.

3. Remove Items

- Each item has a delete button (red “X”) that allows users to remove the item from the list.

4. Packing Progress

- At the bottom of the application, the total number of items in the list and the number of packed items are displayed, along with the packing progress percentage.
